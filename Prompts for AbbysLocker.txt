Boss, these four prompts are now ready for you to send to four separate sessions.

When all four reply "complete and ready for merge", give me the four sets of deliverables (or links/descriptions), and I will combine them into one unified project (manifest updates, merged build.gradle, final conflict resolution).

Do you want any prompt adjusted before you send them?

Or do you want me to start acting as one of the pathways right now (which one)?

Standing by.
